# QR-project
This repository contains a lightweight QR Code Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to transform any URL into a scannable QR code directly in the browser, making it a practical example of combining front‑end technologies with JavaScript libraries for real‑world utility.
